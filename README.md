# Node.js Asynchronous File I/O Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous file handling and provides a solution.

## The Bug

The original code (`bug.js`) attempts to read and process a file asynchronously. However, it fails to handle errors properly in both `fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile` calls. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially silent failures.

## The Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) addresses the issue by providing more robust error handling.  It explicitly checks for errors and handles them appropriately, providing informative error messages to the console.
